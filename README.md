# MATLAB_Flow_Analysis
MATLAB Flow Analysis Code from the Weiss Lab at MIT

This repository contains code compiled from multiple people in the lab. Each person's folder contains all the code needed for their workflow. 

There is likely overlap in function names between each person's code, so it is recommended to only put one in your working directory at a time.
